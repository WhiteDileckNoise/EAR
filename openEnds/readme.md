# 1bit jewelry

This section will introduces the idea of **1bit jewelry**. 

***

The **1bit jewelry** is a tool from the **Open Ends** project of [Hannah Perner-Wilson](https://www.plusea.at/?page_id=1605), [Irene Posch](http://www.ireneposch.net/) and [Martin De Bie](http://martindebie.com/). This project aims to explore the possible combinations between the craftsmanship of jewellery and the conception of electronic objects. We use the **1bit jewelry** as a technical principle to create artefacts of speculative stories.

The technic is based on the **1bit textile** developed by [Irene Posch](http://www.ireneposch.net/) and [Ebru Kurbak](https://ebrukurbak.net/). The process consists of creating an **electromagnetic field** thanks to a **coil** made of conducting wire through which an **electric current** flows. This coil is then confronted to a **magnet** which, depending on the direction of the coil current, will be attracted or repelled. Simple rotation movements are then created, like a pixel with two visual states.

## Magnetism and electromagnetism

**Magnetism** is a physical phenomena that are mediated by **magnetic fields**. It produce, by the motion of electric charge, an attractive and repulsive forces between objects.

**Electromagnetism** is the phenomenon of the interaction of electric currents or fields and magnetic fields.
