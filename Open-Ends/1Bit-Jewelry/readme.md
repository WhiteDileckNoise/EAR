# 1BIT JEWELRY

***

The **1bit jewelry** is a tool from the **Open Ends** project of [Hannah Perner-Wilson](https://www.plusea.at/?page_id=1605), [Irene Posch](http://www.ireneposch.net/) and [Martin De Bie](http://martindebie.com/). This project aims to explore the possible combinations between the **craftsmanship of jewellery** and the **conception of electronic objects**. We use the **1bit jewelry** as a technical principle to create artefacts of speculative stories.

The technic is based on the **1bit textile** developed by [Irene Posch](http://www.ireneposch.net/) and [Ebru Kurbak](https://ebrukurbak.net/). The process consists of creating an **electromagnetic field** thanks to a **coil** made of conducting wire through which an **electric current** flows. This coil is then confronted to a **magnet** which, depending on the direction of the coil current, will be attracted or repelled. Simple rotation movements are then created, like a pixel with two visual states.

## Magnetism and electromagnetism

**Magnetism** is a physical phenomena that are mediated by **magnetic fields**. It produce, by the motion of electric charge, an attractive and repulsive forces between objects.

**Electromagnetism** is the phenomenon of the interaction of electric currents or fields and magnetic fields. In the case of a magnet polarized, the magnetism have a specific way, a **north pole** and **south pole**. When you create an **electromagnet** the direction of the magnetic field depend on the direction of the electric current. So if you change the direction of the curent (positive + and negative -) you can attract or repel a metalic element.

## How to make an electromagnet ?

To build an electromagnet, you need to create a coil inside which the electric current will runs. The electrically charged particles running in loop produce a magnetic field that can attract a piece of metal or an other element with a magnetic field (magnet or electromagnet). 

So you'll need a [source of electricity](https://dicksondata.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/R007.jpg), a [insulted copper wire](https://docs.rs-online.com/817a/0900766b81292580.pdf) and a piece to wrap the cable around.

## Turning it into a 1bit jewelry

Here some examples of experimentations of jewelry integrating coil with copper wire. This modules are using a [hematite magnetic bead](https://www.crystal-creative.com/de/magnetperle-rund-10mm-jet-hematite.html).
