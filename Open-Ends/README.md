# OPEN ENDS 

***

The **Open Ends** is a project of [Hannah Perner-Wilson](https://www.plusea.at/?page_id=1605), [Irene Posch](http://www.ireneposch.net/) and [Martin De Bie](http://martindebie.com/). This project aims to explore the possible combinations between the **craftsmanship of jewellery** and the **conception of electronic objects**.

During a first four-day exchange in the [Volksluxus workshop](https://volksluxus.wordpress.com/) (Berlin), we have followed an introduction by 
[Sybille Jagfeld](https://sybjekt.wordpress.com/) to the techniques of metalworking and more precisely of **silversmith**.

At each step, the possibilities of integrating electronics have been examined, how to make these **artefacts sensitive**, **interactive**. Because silver is a very good electrical conductor, the possibilities to re-imagining the shape of an **electronic circuit** are multiple.

After the first few days, the general exploration turned around the notion of **communication**. Jewels are already an element of communication in a way but could it generate a **new paradigm of exchange**. A system that could bring a **non-verbal** or **non-written** transcription, a simplified, **binary language**, combining emotions to a singular connection with a close person. 

This first phase allowed us to imagine a **speculative scenario** in which part of the artisanal practice of jewellery evolved to fully integrate electronics, thus creating these communication devices.

We began to experiment with small modules based on the **1bit technique** which is described in the [next section](https://github.com/WhiteDileckNoise/EAR/tree/master/Open-Ends/1Bit-Jewelry).
