RESILIENT CRAFT ELECTRONICS

This research project proposes to study what could be a production and the use of electronic objects if they were made on the logic of craftsmanship. Indeed, in view of the environmental situation of our planet, if we want to maintain a liveable environment in the decades to come, we must change our lifestyles and our consumption systems. Encouraging short circuits, relocating production and reducing our consumption are essential element of this change. And this principles are embed in the logics and productive methods of craftsmanship. This field of research speculates on these hybrid productions and profiles which could lead to new kind of knowledge.
